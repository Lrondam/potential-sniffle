# Potential Sniffle

Welcome to **Potential Sniffle**, a project designed to explore and analyze potential trends, patterns, or insights in data related to health, weather, or any other domain. This repository serves as a starting point for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.


## About the Project

**Potential Sniffle** is a data-driven project aimed at uncovering hidden patterns or trends in datasets. Whether you're analyzing health data, weather patterns, or any other type of data, this project provides tools and scripts to help you get started with data exploration and analysis.

The name "Potential Sniffle" reflects the idea of sniffing out potential insights from data, much like how one might detect a sniffle before it turns into a full-blown cold.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lrondam/potential-sniffle.git
   cd potential-sniffle
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the data interactively:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

This project includes scripts and notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and modeling. Here's how you can use them:

- **Data Exploration**: Use the provided Jupyter Notebooks to explore the dataset and perform initial analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize trends and patterns using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
- **Modeling**: Build predictive models using machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow.

Example:
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')

# Plot a simple graph
data['column_name'].plot(kind='hist')
plt.show()
```
